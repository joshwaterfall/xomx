CSV_RNASeq_data is the path towards a .csv file containing TPM-normalized RNASeq data.
It is a matrix in which each column corresponds to a sample, and each row corresponds
to the levels of expression of a particular transcript accross all samples.
The levels of expression are in TPM (Transcripts Per Million), so for each sample the
sum of all values in the column should be equal to 1,000,000.
The first line of the file must have the structure:
"", "sample1-ID-string", "sample2-ID-string", ...
The following lines must have the structure:
